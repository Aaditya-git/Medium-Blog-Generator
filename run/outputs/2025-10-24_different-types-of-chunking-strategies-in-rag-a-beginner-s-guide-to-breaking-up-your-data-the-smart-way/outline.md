Different Types of Chunking Strategies in RAG: A Beginner's Guide to Breaking Up Your Data the Smart Way sounds straightforward until you hit real constraints—data quality, latency, and maintenance. This post shows you how to approach it pragmatically, starting simple and adding complexity only when measurement demands it.

## What You’ll Build
- Define Different Types of Chunking Strategies in RAG: A Beginner's Guide to Breaking Up Your Data the Smart Way in one paragraph and explain where it fits.
- List the core building blocks and typical inputs/outputs.
- Call out adjacent concepts people confuse it with.

## Step-by-Step Quickstart
- Walk through the end-to-end flow at a high level.
- Detail the key knobs: size, latency, quality, cost.
- Show a minimal example or pseudo-code.
- Explain lexical vs. dense retrieval in plain terms.
- Discuss hybrid strategies and when they help.

## Trade-offs & When Not to Use It
- List failure modes, edge cases, and common misconceptions.
- Explain when a leaner alternative is sufficient.
- Provide a measurement-first heuristic to decide.

## Practical Steps & Next Actions
- Step-by-step path from zero to a working baseline.
- Instrumentation to track accuracy and latency.
- Safe next upgrades if/when the baseline is not enough.
